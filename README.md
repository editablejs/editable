# Editable

An experimental rich text editor framework which aims to replace the native `contenteditable` attribute with a self-drawn cursor to provide richer and more stable editing capabilities.

## Development

Use `vite` & `nx` to build a development environment, use `typescript` for development, and use jest for unit testing.

```bash
# Install
pnpm install

# start up
pnpm dev

```

## Directory Structure

All source codes are in packages, and the apps directory is mainly used for documentation and test cases. Now, in the initial development phase, a React rendering editor model and the logic of model update are written for visual testing.

### packages/editable-breaker

Mainly index some `unicode` characters. Because the number of bytes occupied by some characters is uncertain, resulting in inaccurate indexes after some characters are split, so this toolkit is needed to solve this problem.

### packages/editable-editor

Use the slatejs data model, and use react to render in the self-drawn cursor mode, no longer relying on the contenteditable attribute

### packages/editable-plugins
